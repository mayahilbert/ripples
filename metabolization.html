                <p><cite>Metabolization</cite> is a work about friendship, loss, and memory. It spans footage over the
                    course of a year using a childhood handheld camcorder to amass hundreds of hours of footage. The
                    work was made as the artist was living in college on the brink of the pandemic and was edited almost
                    a year after. The work started as a structured project about scopophilia, “the love of looking” and
                    was meant to examine over a three-month period the subjects' experience with being filmed
                    constantly. However, after the pandemic and the death of the artist's father, and after further
                    reflection on the unedited footage, the work became something else completely and took on more
                    intimate grounds. The work uses poetry and candid moments of self-discovery and friendship to tie in
                    themes of deep loss and the mystery of memory. <cite>Metabolization</cite> is commemorative to the
                    artist's late father.</p>
