                <p><cite>Small Aspirations</cite> is based on critical play that critiques, subverts, and explores
                    alternatives to
                    the misunderstood immigration experience. I draw from both the traditional form of play (e.g., three
                    object play) as well as video game play (e.g., puzzler) to inform the design of a web-based VR
                    experience inspired by a fortune-telling custom in which a baby is given three objects to choose
                    from at their first birthday, each of which symbolizes a path the child aspires to follow when they
                    become adults. Here the player is a first-time immigrant to the U.S., choosing jobs such
                    as restaurant and construction worker that are not glamorous but essential. </p>
