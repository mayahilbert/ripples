                <p><cite>My 4,500 Hexagons</cite> is a multimedia work (consisting of photographs of a quilt and a
                    documentary short) that examines transracial adoption, Asian American immigration, family, and
                    healing. The quilt is a woven mosaic of over 4,500 hexagons, composed of textile fragments collected
                    from the artist's personal relationships, childhood, and creative projects in costume and apparel
                    design from the past 7 years. The documentary follows the artist's journey to complete the quilt, in
                    the process reshaping her relationship with her adoptive mother and herself.</p>
                <p>
                    All three artists were brought together over our shared experiences as Asian Americans in the US who
                    are seeking belonging not just in a country that can feel foreign and hostile to us, but also in our
                    own families as we grapple with feelings of isolation and estrangement.
                    As we shared space and connected over commonalities in our lived experiences as artists, both works
                    (the quilt and film) co-created one another and each work was completed in July 2023. Ultimately,
                    the film became a document of two filmmakers forming a relationship with the artist and the process
                    of creating the documentary caused ripples in all our lives, inspiring us to make sense of our
                    individual and shared experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both pieces will forever be interconnected and together they reframe what healing and care in Asian
                    American families and communities can look like.</p>
