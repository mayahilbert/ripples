                <p>The video walks through a forest somewhere on Earth, far from civilization and geography. It declares
                    in 24 languages, "This Planet is Our home," while looking up at the sky. Modern civilization has
                    pursued material wealth for a better life. However, it is now widely recognized that the production
                    of materials beyond what is necessary for human subsistence threatens the survival of living things.
                    Excessive material consumption is a serious threat to the survival of living things. It is
                    imperative to prioritize the survival of living beings over the pursuit of material wealth. To
                    address this issue, we must reexamine the diversity of values and lifestyles around the world and
                    redefine the concept of wealth. What the above points have in common is that acquiring more things
                    does not necessarily lead to future happiness or fulfillment. We must live together on this planet.
                    This is the highest priority. Failure to do so will lead to the extinction of all living things, not
                    just humans. We don't have enough time to live comfortably on another planet. The video can be
                    freely distributed. A large part of the Anthropocene is the accumulation of limitless material
                    desire in a monetary economy. We artists are also faced with the need to reconstruct our way of
                    life. The greatest feature of digital art is that real art can be copied infinitely. It destroys the
                    greedy material possessions of money worship, restores art's extraordinary financial commodity
                    value, and revives its connection to the individual viewer. </p>

                    <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
                    <p>Kenji Kojima was born in Japan and moved to New York City in 1980. He spent his first 10 years in
                        New
                        York City painting in egg tempera. Citibank, Hess Oil and others collected his paintings. The
                        personal computer improved rapidly in the 1980s. He felt more comfortable doing computer art
                        than
                        painting. He converted his artwork to digital in the early 1990s. His early digital works were
                        archived at the New Museum - Rhizome, New York. In 2007, he developed the computer software "RGB
                        MusicLab" and created an interdisciplinary work exploring the relationship between images and
                        music.
                        In 2014 he programmed the software "Luce" for the project "Techno Synesthesia". His digital art
                        series has been exhibited in New York, at media art festivals around the world, including
                        Europe,
                        Brazil, and Asia, and in the online exhibitions of ACM SIGGRAPH, FILE, and ALL STREET, New York.
