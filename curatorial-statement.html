                <p>We are both products and producers of our environment, molded by the countless waves that wash over
                    us, and in turn, sculpting our surroundings with the waves we set in motion. From the habits we
                    adopt to the sayings we share, every interaction leaves an expanding mark on the world. The artists
                    of <cite>ripples</cite> trace these transient waves back to their source, reflecting upon the
                    influence of our predecessors and how we influence those who come after. With art as their vessel,
                    they gather up slippery, ephemeral abstractions and pour them into a concrete medium we can
                    perceive, hear, and remember.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <cite>ripples</cite> delves into interconnectivity, revealing how art can unveil the subtle threads
                    that weave our diverse lived experiences into a shared existence. Every action, every decision, and
                    every experience sends ripples cascading far beyond their inception. The works focus intensely on
                    these moments of impact, following the ripples emanating from encounters spanning death, labor,
                    self-identity, immigration, surveillance, misinformation, the climate crisis–and the role of art in
                    making sense of the chaos of memories and potentialities. These artworks serve as beacons,
                    illuminating the interconnected tapestry of human experience and the transformative power of art to
                    unleash meaning from life’s challenges and possibilities.

                <p>
                    Through the series <cite>Nature Simulation</cite> by Jingyi Chen, we are taken into realms that
                    ripple visually, touching on the interconnectedness of human life. In <cite>Sacred Waters 2</cite>
                    by Kelly Niceley, ripples are represented visually again within the waves of the Atlantic Ocean,
                    showing that not only does water ripple but also carries history. <cite>Metabolization</cite> by
                    Jayne Breakfast displays history within filmed memories, showcasing the rippling of morphed events
                    that blossom from loss. These works, among others in the exhibition, capture the vast
                    interpretations of <cite>ripples</cite>, from immigrant journeys to particle systems, all
                    contributing to a complex, living system.
