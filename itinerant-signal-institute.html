                <p><cite>Itinerant Signal Institute</cite> is a project that leverages open-source technology to examine
                    and
                    communicate about land use. As we move into a new era of potentially increasing climate migration,
                    the project will create a network of sensors that will expose data on air and soil toxicity. Several
                    small servers are set up in places adjacent to Superfund sites and other toxic locations, to test
                    for environmental conditions related to the greenhouse effect. These will show the immediate impact
                    of human activity within microclimates around New York City, which affect shifts in temperature and
                    weather patterns worldwide. The information will help with decision-making on whether it's safe to
                    stay in the area, or better to flee. The history of human migration will influence the work, as well
                    as cultural artifacts related to the changing of seasons, which will be used to tell the story of
                    the project. My own family lived near the Newton Creek Superfund site when they emigrated here.
